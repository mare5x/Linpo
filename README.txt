LINPO (LINes & POints)

-----------------------------------------------------------

CONCEPT

A dotted grid of customizable size (eg. 10x10).
Player 1 makes a move by connecting two unclaimed dots on the grid.
	If Player 1 filled a box (1x1), he gets another move and points based on the number of his lines in the box.
Player 2's turn when Player 1 places a line that doesn't fill a box.

Only the player who last fills a box gets points for it, even if the box is also composed of the other player's lines.

The game ends when no more lines can be placed.

The player with the most points wins the game.

Player 1's lines differ from the opposing player's lines by color.
